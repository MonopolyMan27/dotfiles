# dotfiles

Hello, feel free to copy anything from my dotfiles. 

I use vim-plug to manage my nvim extenstions, so make sure to run `:PlugInstall` after saving changes in order to load the extensions.

Save the `powerline-shell` folder to `~/.config/` and save `mythemes` to your home directory (`~/`) in order to deploy my powerline shell theme. Then, copy the ps1 function from my `.bashrc` into yours.

My `xorg.conf.d` folder goes into `etc/X11/`.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
