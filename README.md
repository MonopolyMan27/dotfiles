# dotfiles

Hello, feel free to copy anything from my dotfiles. 

I use vim-plug to manage my nvim extenstions, so make sure to run `:PlugInstall` after saving changes in order to load the extensions.

`config.def.h` is my slstatus configuration, `config.h` is my dwm configuration

`gruvbox.py` is my powerline-shell theme. Deploy it by saving the file to `~/mythemes/` and then saving my config.json file to `~/.config/powerline-shell/`

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
