# dotfiles

Hello, feel free to copy anything from my dotfiles. 

I use vim-plug to manage my nvim extenstions, so make sure to run :PlugInstall after saving changes in order to load the extensions.

config.def.h is my slstatus configuration, config.h is my dwm configuration

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
